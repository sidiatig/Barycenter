# Barycenter
generate samples for Wasserstein Barycenter

We give two ways to generate samples for Wasserstein Barycenter.
One is to compute Wasserstein distance directly via Sinkhorn itertive algorithm. See paper ["Sinkhorn Distances: Lightspeed Computation of Optimal Transport"](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4927-sinkhorn-distances-lightspeed-computation-of-optimal-transport.pdf)
The other is computed by solving dual formula for primary Wasserstein distance.See paper ["Wasserstein gan"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875)
